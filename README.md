# URL-Finder
A program to find a url given a list of companies



This script creates a pandas DataFrame to store the company names and URLs. After extracting the URLs using Selenium, it appends the data to the DataFrame and then exports the DataFrame to an Excel file named "company_urls.xlsx".

Remember to handle exceptions and edge cases as needed in a real-world scenario. Also, make sure the column names in the DataFrame match the desired format for your Excel file.
